# Algorithms, Part I Submissions

This repository contains my submissions for **Algorithms, Part I** course from **Princeton University** in **Coursera**.
I attemptted to get 100% score on everything (including bonus).
The repository is here so that I do not lose the code and can use them later for my personal reference.
However, I dont really mind other people seeing my code so a BSD-3-Clause license is provided.

The course is currently free to join in the url: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1

## Setup

To use the code in this repo for reference purposes, you need two thing.
1. [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar) binary
2. classpath added to your IDEA settings.

However, IntelliJ IDEA seems to detect the library and add it classpath automatically.
And for VS Code support, I added my `.vscode` folder so it should work too.

So, you only need to run the following commands to get autocompletion:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/touhidurrr/algorithms-part1.git
cd algorithms-part1
mkdir libs
curl -o libs/algs4.jar https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar
```

After this just open the folder with IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.
